      Best Hamburger Patty Recipe - Thick or thin, made on the grill or
      stovetop, this is the best and easiest all-purpose recipe for perfect
      hamburger patties every time!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ground chuck – We prefer an 80 lean/20 fat ratio for the juiciest
        burgers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs – The best binders for juicy
        hamburgers. (Could be gluten-free!)
      </li>
      <li>Worcestershire sauce – Adds a deep beefy, smoky flavor.</li>
      <li>Egg – To bind all of the ingredients together without drying.</li>
      <li>Milk – The enzymes help to soften and tenderize the ground beef.</li>
      <li>
        Seasonings: Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Pepper, or other spices
        of choice.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        First, set out a large mixing bowl and add in the ground beef, crushed
        crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, and spices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife to
        cut and divide the hamburger patty mixture into 6 – 1/3 pound grill or
        skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle patties. Like so:
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat, approximately
        350-400 degrees F.
      </li>
    </ol>
