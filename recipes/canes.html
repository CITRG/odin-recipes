    <p>
      Raising Canes is a restaurant known for its chicken fingers. Raising
      Cane’s Chicken Tenders are known to be the best because they use fresh,
      never frozen chicken that is hand battered and fried in 100% vegetable
      oil. This Chicken Finger recipe copycats Raising Cane’s Chicken Tenders.

      <li>Dip into the dredge (3/4 cup buttermilk + 1 tbsp seasoning blend)</li>
      <li>Dip back into the flour mix and coat well.</li>
      <li>Place on wire rack for a minimum of 10 mins.</li>
      <li>By this point the oil will be ready for the chicken.</li>

        To test it, drop a little flour over into the oil. When it sizzles the
        oil is hot enough.
